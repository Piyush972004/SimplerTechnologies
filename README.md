## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Data is stored in a `data.json` file located in the `src/` folder.
2. `axios` is used in the `UserList` component to fetch the data when the component mounts.
3. Data is filtered using the value from the search bar.
4. Each user is displayed in a Material UI Table with their details.
5. UI elements are styled using MUI components like `Table`, `TextField`, and `Paper`.
